  <h2><u>Fair Date/Time: Saturday, February 11th, 2023 at 9:00 AM</u></h2>
    
  <p>
    Due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the date, format, and
    location (virtual/indoors/outdoors) of fair is subject 
    to change. The PTO will announce any changes in fair date and location in the coming
    weeks.

  <p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> your project does <em>not</em> have to be
    about Space and Space Exploration. Your project can be about whatever you are excited about!
